I haven’t felt it much at all, at least not recently. 2025 has been a year, a whole year, by my reckoning.</p> <h3 id=unemployed>Unemployed</h3> <p>It’s been nearly a year since my previous post, since I was feeling <a href=https://lzon.ca/posts/post-2025-01-17/>grateful</a>. I did in fact lose my job. It was at the end of February, and it wasn’t surprising. I feel I handled it well initially, or at least regarded my unemployment with appropriate seriousness. I immediately got to work: I updated my resume, my professional website, and even attempted to register a business. I did well to keep myself motivated. I know very well the rot that creeps into a person when they are unemployed for too long, and beyond anything else I was motivated to prevent that from happening.</p> <p>I’ve submitted several dozen applications this year. By some standard, that no longer exists, that might have been a lot (or at least an appropriate amount). I realize fully that by modern standards it is not nearly enough. I haven’t had a single follow up, and of course no interviews.</p> <p>I struggle in the extreme with feelings of judgement, and I always have. It makes job applications difficult, especially when I am taking them seriously. A few of my applications were for jobs I genuinely wanted, and it hurt when I didn’t even get a response. Many times I intentionally applied to jobs I didn’t care for, or otherwise was barely qualified, just to tell myself that I was trying.</p> <h3 id=it-starts-creeping-back>It starts creeping back</h3> <p>What is creeping? I think the best single word for it is merely ‘despair’. Deep despair, deeper that I ever thought possible before I felt it. Complete, and fully internalized hopelessness. I was being consumed by it before finding my job, and by summer this year I was beginning to feel it again.</p> <p>The thinnest of silver linings is that I saw it coming. The despair is here again. I wasn’t able to stop it, but I have (so far) discovered ways to live with it. To not let it destroy me.</p> <p>Not that I actually care anymore about my future. I wake up every day on a mission:</p> <ul><li>At 6:50am, every day, I get out of bed.<li>I exercise. Hard, for 1 hour.<li>I attend to my hygeine, and the tidyness of my living space.<li>I go to my computer and begin working. On anything. If my progress on any given project begins to stall, I panic, and grab desperately for something else to do. I force myself to believe that working on these projects counts as ‘productivity’.<li>I go out to buy groceries in the afternoon, and eat a single meal, my supper, at 6pm.<li>My energy is mostly spent by the evening, and I can’t even enjoy a video game. So most days I do nothing until going to bed.<li>In general, I don’t sleep well.</ul> <p>I have become ridgidly attached to my schedule. I panic whenever it is disrupted (e.g. eating supper 30 minutes later than usual), because it represents stability. It’s my flimsy defense against chaos. Its predictable and reliable. I really don’t like living this way, but I know that if not for this, my life would be so much worse.</p> <h3 id=the-motorcycle>The Motorcycle</h3> <p>In early summer I was consistently becoming stalled on all of my projects. Lingering panic was setting in, and after doom scrolling Marketplace my brain began to latch on to the idea of buying a motorcycle. I’m sure a part of me was genuinely excited by the prospect, but my attitude was ultimately fatalistic. I wanted a motorcycle because learning to ride was ‘something to do’, ‘anything to do’. I also was genuinely happy for the possibility of a dramatic (and quick) death if I had a crash. What happens next feels like punishment from the universe for daring to hope that I could be put out of my misery quickly and cleanly.</p> <h3 id=the-broken-foot>The Broken Foot</h3> <p>I rode the bike for 1 week. Then, at a complete stand-still, I lost my balance. The bike fell, with me under it, and my foot was crushed.</p> <p>Multiple bones were broken, others were fractured. I was put into a cast that evening, and thus began the next 8 weeks.</p> <p>By all outward appearances, I must have seemed to be taking it well. I had exactly two outbursts, which I intentionally allowed myself to have. I shouted, and stomped (with my walker). Beyond that, I did not complain much at all.</p> <p>I maintained my schedule, I never missed a workout. I modified my stationary bike to accomodate the cast, and continued to ride. In a very real sense I was acting out of spite to the universe, for having done this to me. I did everything in my power to prevent it from disrupting me.</p> <p>Overall, I feel I was genuinely more content during this time than I was before, and now. It felt justified to let go of my concerns about my life trajectory, at least for a while. I’ve tried to maintain this mindset after I began walking again, but unsurprisingly that hasn’t happened. I can feel the weight of the future again. It feels heavy, opaque, and threatening.</p> <h3 id=11-51am>11:51AM</h3> <p>It’s almost noon. I haven’t completed a notable task yet on any of my projects. I’ll scramble to get something done, to alleviate the anxiety.</p> <p>Most years seem to go by quickly, especially as you get older. For me, 2025 has felt like a whole-ass year.</p> </post-content> </post> </region-content> </region> </body-main><body-footer> <footer>Site Build Date: December 22, 2025.
